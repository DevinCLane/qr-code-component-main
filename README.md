## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Going deeper on CSS units like ch, vh, rem, etc
-   setting custom properties
-   using flexbox and margin to center items
-   writing vanilla CSS for the first time in a while (been using Tailwind 😅)

### Continued development

-   Going deeper on when and why to create classes and IDs, how to organize your CSS better, going deeper on ch, rem, vh, and the specific CSS units beyond px, mobile first development, responsive design

### Useful resources
